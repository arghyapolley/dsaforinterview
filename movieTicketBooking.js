/* # Movie Ticket Booking Application - Problem Statement

## Overview
Implement a Movie Ticket Booking Application for a Theatre. The application should handle the complete booking flow from seat selection to payment confirmation.

## System Requirements

### Theatre Structure
- **A Theatre has Screens** that run Shows for different Movies
- Each Show has a particular Movie, start time, duration, and is played in a particular Screen in the theatre
- Each Screen in the theatre has an arrangement of Seats that can be booked by Users

### User Management
- **Assume all Users are registered, authenticated, and logged in** to the Application

### Booking Flow

#### 1. Show Selection
- Once a User selects a particular show to book tickets for, a **UserBookingSession** starts
- Within this UserBookingSession, a User will be able to get the Available Seats for the show and select the Seats he wishes to book

#### 2. Seat Selection and Reservation
- It is **'good to have'** for the Application to have limits on the number of seats a User can book in a Ticket
- Once the user has selected a group of seats, these seats should become **TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE** to all other Users

#### 3. Payment Processing
- The User then proceeds to make payment which can either be **SUCCESS or FAILURE**

#### 4. Payment Failure Handling
- **If Payment FAILED**: User can retry Payment for a maximum number of times. Beyond maximum retries, the seats are made **AVAILABLE**

#### 5. Payment Success Handling
- **If Payment SUCCEEDS**: Ticket or Booking Confirmation is generated and made available to the User. The UserBookingSession is closed and the Seats are made **PERMANENTLY_UNAVAILABLE**

#### 6. Manual Session Closure
- A User can also explicitly close the UserBookingSession after selecting seats and before making payment. In this case, the seats selected are made **AVAILABLE** once again

## Seat Status States
The system should manage three seat states:
1. **AVAILABLE** - Seat can be booked
2. **TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE** - Seat is reserved during an active booking session
3. **PERMANENTLY_UNAVAILABLE** - Seat has been successfully booked

## Technical Requirements
- Implement the solution using **JavaScript only**
- Focus on the **functional part** with **console.log** for output
- Handle all the booking scenarios mentioned above
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Ensure thread-safety considerations for concurrent bookings

## Expected Features
- Theatre initialization with screens, movies, and shows
- User session management
- Seat availability checking and selection
- Payment processing simulation
- Booking confirmation generation
- Session cleanup and seat release mechanisms
- Comprehensive logging of all operations

## Success Criteria
The application should successfully demonstrate:
1. Multiple users booking tickets simultaneously
2. Proper seat reservation and release mechanisms
3. Payment success and failure scenarios
4. Session management and cleanup
5. Complete audit trail through console logging */
